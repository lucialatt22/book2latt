# Book2Latt Vercel Deployment - Changes Documentation

## Overview
This document details all changes made to the Book2Latt application to fix deployment issues on Vercel. The primary issue was that the original application was built for Cloudflare Pages/Workers with Cloudflare D1 database, which is incompatible with Vercel's deployment environment.

## Database Migration
### Original Implementation
- Used Cloudflare D1 database (referenced in wrangler.toml)
- Database binding was configured in wrangler.toml as `DB`
- All service files accessed the database through Cloudflare's environment context

### New Implementation
- Migrated to Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL support
- Created a comprehensive Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added a centralized database client in `src/lib/database.ts`
- Added database seed script in `prisma/seed.js` to initialize test data

## Service Layer Refactoring
### Files Modified
1. `src/lib/auth/user-service.ts`
   - Replaced Cloudflare D1 database calls with Prisma client
   - Maintained the same functionality for user authentication and management

2. `src/lib/products/product-service.ts`
   - Refactored to use Prisma client for product operations
   - Preserved all product management functionality

3. `src/lib/orders/order-service.ts`
   - Updated to use Prisma for order management
   - Maintained all order-related functionality

## Environment Configuration
### Original Implementation
- Used `CLOUDFLARE_CONTEXT` environment variable
- Accessed through `getCloudflareContext()` function in `src/lib/cloudflare.ts`

### New Implementation
- Created `src/lib/env.ts` for centralized environment variable management
- Added `.env` file for local development
- Updated environment variable references throughout the codebase
- Added documentation for required environment variables in Vercel

## Configuration Updates
### Files Modified
1. `package.json`
   - Added Prisma-related scripts for database management
   - Added postinstall hook for Prisma client generation

2. `middleware.ts`
   - Maintained the same authentication middleware functionality
   - Ensured compatibility with Vercel's environment

3. `next.config.js`
   - Kept the same configuration which is compatible with Vercel

### Files Removed
1. `wrangler.toml` (not needed for Vercel deployment)
2. `src/lib/cloudflare.ts` (replaced with env.ts)

## Documentation Added
1. `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - Comprehensive guide for deploying the application on Vercel
   - Instructions for setting up the database
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Deployment steps

## Testing
- Created seed data that matches the screenshots provided
- Verified all features work correctly with the new database implementation
- Ensured the application maintains the same functionality as shown in screenshots

## Additional Improvements
- Added proper connection pooling through Prisma for better performance in serverless environments
- Improved error handling in database operations
- Added type safety with Prisma's generated types
